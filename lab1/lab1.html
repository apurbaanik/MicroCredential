<p>
I am a junior at Brooklyn College, majoring in Electrical Engineering. I took 3
programming classes based on Java and next semester I will be taking C++. The
reason I am taking this microcredential is to learn full stack web development.
Many internhsips requires to know full stack web development as a skill, so it
will be great to have this on my resume.
